Project Title - Heart Disease Risk Factors 

This project looks into risk factors that we decided to analyze, and see what factors have a significant impact on heart disease. The seven factors we looked at were BMI, Age, Smoking, Sex, Physical Activity, Sleep Time and general Alcohol consumption.

ABOUT 

This project took the dataset from kaggle called heart_cleaned_2020.csv
The dataset contained nearly 400,000 adults, along with their data. Most of the dataset was binary (Yes/No), with BMI and Sleep Hours being the only 2 variables with actual numbers. 



GETTING STARTED 

From here we decided to narrow the dataset, as there were numerous columns, and not all columns would be analyzed. Our team analyzed each variable and presented our finding in the reduced dataset (after it was cleaned). From here we determined which variables had either a significant impact, or just a marginal impact. We decided on 7 columns (mentioned above). Each of us took 2 variables, while one person took one variable and was the git hub administrator. After narrowing the dataset, we decided to analyze the data, and see which variables have an impact on heart disease. The binning method was used, as it was a key tool, which we learned in previous lessons. From here we were able to break down each variable, and show our findings. 

We each came up with our initial hypothesis of what we thought the results were going to show. We believed that the 7 factors would have a significant impact on heart disease. After each variable was analyzed and visualizations were created, we came up with our conclusion to determine which variables had significant impact and which had marginal impact. From our findings/analysis, we saw that BMI, Age (older demographic) and Smoking had significant impact. Meanwhile, basic Alcohol Consumption, Gender, Sleep Time and Physical Acitivity only had a marginal impact.
